# JavaScript And You

JavaScript is a lightweight, dynamic, and object-oriented programming language.  It's also one of the most
widely deployed programming languages in the world, owing to its presence in the web browser installed on nearly every desktop
computer in the world.  Because of the large and diverse communities of programmers that build client applications for the browser, 
JavaScript is also one of the most widely known programming languages in the world - making it an excellent match for a 
cross-platform development tool like Titanium.

But in addition to being widely deployed and widely known, JavaScript is also AWESOME.  Useful for object-oriented programming,
quick and dirty scripting, and many use cases in between, JavaScript is showing up everywhere (desktops, mobile devices, servers,
AAA games, and more).  If you don't know JavaScript, it is a very wise investment of your time to learn it well.

As was stated earlier, JavaScript is AWESOME.  Here are a few of the features you will love:

* Dynamic typing (which allows [Duck typing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing))
* [Functional programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
* Convenient object literal notation
* A small set of standard functions and syntactical elements - learn the whole language in a day!

JavaScript can be your friend if you take the time to learn how to use it properly.  Here are a few resources to help you get started.

# Online Resources

There are a number of freely available JavaScript resources on the web you can check out right now, and will likely want
to refer back to as you build your Titanium application.

## MDC JavaScript Documentation

Mozilla maintains an [excellent JavaScript documentation site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/javascript), which very conveniently
leaves out the DOM-specific programming tasks (which you'll rarely use in a native Titanium application).  The MDC JavaScript site
provides two key elements - an [API doc source for JavaScript object types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference) and
an [introduction to programming JavaScript in general](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide).  The JavaScript Guide
will contain some browser-specific items that aren't included in the Titanium JavaScript environment, but the core techniques will be
the same.

For a quick and dirty introduction to JavaScript, you can't do much better.

## CROCKFORD

Considered by many to be the premier JavaScript expert in the world, Douglas Crockford maintains a listing of JavaScript resources
[on his personal website](http://javascript.crockford.com/), all of which are definitely worth checking out.  Many technologies pioneered
by Crockford are embedded in Titanium in one way or another, including his [JSLint code validator](http://www.jslint.com/) and 
[public domain JSON serialization library](http://www.json.org/).

## Google JavaScript Style Guide

The Google, a major purveyor of JavaScript awesomeness, has published
[a set of JavaScript code style guidelines](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml).  If you care about
beautiful and consistent code (and who doesn't?), you could do worse than following these style guidelines.

## JavaScript in 10 minutes

The title of [this guide](https://github.com/spencertipping/js-in-ten-minutes) is deceptive, as you might think it is targeted at
beginners.  It is not, but it is chock full of 'pro tips' about the sometimes odd behavior of the JavaScript interpreter.  Worth a 
quick read even by seasoned JavaScripters.


# Books

Here are a few good ones to get you started:

* [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748)
* [JavaScript Patterns](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596806767)
