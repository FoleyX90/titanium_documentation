# Help Resources

We all get by with a little help from our friends.  Here are a few ways to get help using
and mastering Titanium.

## Reference Documentation

In addition to these guides, we have more comprehensive API level documentation 
[available at our developer website](http://developer.appcelerator.com/documentation).

## Community Q&A

We have a [community-driven question and answer board](http://developer.appcelerator.com/questions) that is 
primarily supported by your fellow Titanium developers.  Chances are good that someone has already seen an issue similar
to yours, so this is the best place to start searching when you have a question.  If no one has
asked your question, go ahead and fire off your own.

## Community Resources

As the Titanium community has grown, so too have the resources on Titanium available out on the web.  Every day we see
more blogs, tutorials, and snippets posted about Titanium, which is great.  Firing up your favorite search engine will
yield good results if you can't immediately find the answer you're looking for in the Docs or Q&A.

## IRC Chat

Appcelerator maintains a number of IRC channels that we use for real time chat and ad hoc support.  We
use [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) as our IRC server and maintain the following channels:

* `#titanium_app` : This is for general Titanium usage questions - probably what you're looking for
* `#titanium_dev` : This channel is for discussion on Titanium internals - used by employees, contributors, and module hackers
* `#appcelerator` : No real purpose - come by and say hi, see if anyone's hanging out ;)

If you don't have an IRC client installed on your machine, there is a [minimal web interface](http://webchat.freenode.net/)
that will get the job done for you.  Drop in and say hi!

## Pro Support

For SLA-driven support directly from the Appcelerator team, you can 
[upgrade to a Pro or Enterprise subscription](https://my.appcelerator.com/account).
A paid account gives you access to a premium support help desk staffed by Appcelerator engineers, in addition to access to 
special training materials, early access to product betas, and many other benefits that we intend to grow out over time.
You're also directly supporting the great open source projects that we make available to the world free of charge - how cool are you!
