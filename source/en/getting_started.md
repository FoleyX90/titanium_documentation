# Downloading Titanium

## Development environment requirements

You're ready to go â€“ you've got your computer all set up, and ready to start working with Titanium. These are the development environments that are supported. You may find that slightly down-rev operating systems work fine as well, but these are the versions that we've tested.

<info>
The following are the supported environments:

* Mac OS X 10.6.4 (Snow Leopard)
* Windows 7, XP and Vista
* Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala)
</info>


### Mac OS X

Using Mac OS X, you can build mobile apps for iPhone, iPad and Android.
We've tested Mac OS X version 10.6.4, but earlier versions of 10.6 (Snow Leopard) should work as well. (Please let us know if you have any trouble.)

<note>If you're developing for iPhone or iPad, you must use Mac OS X for your development. Note that the current iOS (iPhone and iPad) SDK will not run on Mac OS X systems earlier than Snow Leopard.</note>


### Windows

We have tested these procedures with Windows 7. You may be able to use earlier versions of Windows, but we haven't fully tested them, and they aren't supported.

### Linux

We've tested Titanium mobile development with Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala).
You can try using other Linux distributions to develop with Titanium, but this Ubuntu distribution is the one that we test with and support. If you have trouble or success with another distribution, please let us know.


# Installing Titanium

Appcelerator's Developer Web site contains information you'll need to configure your development system, and then begin development using the sample programs. Using your Web browser, navigate to [http://developer.appcelerator.com/get_started](http://developer.appcelerator.com/get_started).

Here's the Web page you'll see:

![webpage](../assets/images/guides/getting_started/webpage.png)

At the bottom of the page, you'll see several helpful getting started videos that you can watch. You can watch them now or later; when you're ready, continue on with these instructions.

In this section, you'll install the components on the right that you'll use to develop mobile applications with Titanium, using Mac OS X.

There are several API revision levels, and different versions of the SDK's that we'll be navigating through in this section. You'll want to follow these installation steps in order.
