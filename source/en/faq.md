# I need help with Titanium. Can you help me?

We offer two forms of support with Titanium:

* **Community Support**. Community support is available at our [Developer Center](http://developer.appcelerator.com) website free-of-charge. It's community supported, meaning everyone helps each other out with no commitment.  It's the open source way. Give a little, take a little.

# What is your License?

The Titanium SDK is licensed under the Apache Public License (version 2).

# Where can I download Titanium?

You can download Titanium from our [Product Download](http://www.appcelerator.com/download) page.

# Do I need a Macintosh to use Titanium for building iPhone or iPad apps?

Yes. The Apple terms of service require you to use their tooling and a Macintosh computer to build native applications and Titanium requires these tools.

# Where can I find the source code to Titanium?

You can find the latest version of the Titanium source code at our [GitHub project page](http://www.github.com/appcelerator).

# How is Titanium different than PhoneGap, Rhomobile, etc.?

Titanium is similar in concept - use can use your web skills to build a cross-platform application for mobile, tablet, etc - however, much different in technical implementation and 
breadth of offering.  Titanium leverages the JavaScript language as the main way to build your applications but we compile your applications into native code and into a real native application for each target platform.  Titanium applications do not run on top of WebKit and are not styled to look like native applications (we call these faux user interfaces).  However, with Titanium, you can gain access to a WebView and load web-oriented, HTML5 content as a normal Titanium native view.

# What can I not do with Titanium?

You cannot build a nuclear reactor, an atomic bomb or a real ninja sword - although you could try.  Titanium is very flexible, fully extensible and has most of the native APIs for each platform.  However, Titanium is typically only limited by your own imagination and what Apple decides is good enough for the App Store.  Other than that, sky's the limit. If you find a limitation, let us know.

# I would like to help contribute, how can I?
